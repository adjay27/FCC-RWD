            Ir. Soekarno, the first President of Indonesia, had a significant
            impact on the country's history. Here are some key achievements and
            details about him:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>1901</strong> - Soekarno is born on June 6, in Surabaya,
              East Java, Dutch East Indies (now Indonesia).
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>1926</strong> - Soekarno studied civil engineering at the
              Technische Hoogeschool (TH) in Bandung, Dutch East Indies (now
              Bandung Institute of Technology or ITB). He graduated in 1926 with
              the degree of Ingenieur (Ir.), which is equivalent to a bachelor's
              degree in engineering.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>1927</strong> - Soekarno establishes the Indonesian
              National Party (Partai Nasional Indonesia or PNI) and becomes its
              leader. He begins to actively advocate for Indonesian
              independence.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>1942-1945</strong> - Indonesia is occupied by the Japanese
              during World War II. Soekarno initially cooperates with the
              Japanese authorities, hoping for support in gaining independence.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>1945</strong> - On August 17, just days after Japan's
              surrender, Soekarno and Mohammad Hatta proclaim the independence
              of Indonesia. Soekarno becomes the first President of the Republic
              of Indonesia.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>1949</strong> - The Dutch, who had tried to reassert
              control over Indonesia after World War II, recognize Indonesia's
              independence following diplomatic negotiations.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>1955</strong> - Soekarno convenes the Asia-Africa
              Conference in Bandung, Indonesia. The conference aims to promote
              Afro-Asian economic and cultural cooperation and is a significant
              event in the history of the Non-Aligned Movement.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>1956</strong> - Soekarno introduces the concept of "Guided
              Democracy," which centralizes political power in the presidency.
              This marks a shift toward a more authoritarian style of
              government.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>1963</strong> - Indonesia annexes Western New Guinea (now
              Papua) from Dutch control after a controversial and
              conflict-ridden process.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>1965</strong> - A failed coup attempt, attributed to
              communists, occurs in Indonesia. This event leads to
              anti-communist purges, and Soekarno's power diminishes. General
              Suharto emerges as a prominent military leader.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>1967</strong> - Soekarno is gradually sidelined, and on
              March 12, he formally transfers executive power to General
              Suharto. Soekarno remains under house arrest until his death.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>1970</strong> - Soekarno passes away on June 21, in
              Jakarta, Indonesia.
            </li>
          </ul>
          Soekarno's legacy is complex, with supporters praising his role in
          achieving independence and promoting Third World unity, while critics
          highlight his authoritarian tendencies and the tumultuous events
          surrounding his later years in power.<br /><br />
